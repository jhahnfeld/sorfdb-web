    <h1>About sORFdb</h1>
    <p>
      sORFdb is a database for sORFs, small proteins, and small protein groups
      in bacteria.
      <br />
      It provides search and browsable sORF and small protein sequence data as
      well as small protein families. The database is taxonomy independent and
      the entries were quality-filtered for sORFs and small proteins with
      evidence.

      sORFdb is a specialized (unlike GenBank, Swiss-Prot and UniProt), taxonomy
      independent (unlike SmProt) and quality-filtered (unlike GenBank and
      UniProt) database for sORFs and small proteins. It combines and
      complements the quality-filtered databases mentioned above into a
      comprehensive database. Additionally, for small protein families are
      provided with a product description and metrics based on the family
      members. The website provides various functions for sequence and family
      based small protein search and for sORF sequence search. The complete
      database and small proteins can be interactively explored using the browse
      function. All data are freely available for download.
